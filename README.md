# R-Shiny-Covid-Impact-on-Retailer-Business
This project used google mobility data to analyze which locations were most hit by Covid breakout, which locations are moderately impacted, such that retailers can refer to the insights to better allocate the resources to meet the needs and save the operations costs.

The primary output is a flexdashboard in R so the business partners can have a holistic overview as well as flexibility in choosing the appropriate thresholds that best suit the business capability.
